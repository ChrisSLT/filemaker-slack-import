# filemaker-slack-import

## Purpose
In Filemaker Pro, create an easy to read html log of slack messages from public or private groups and direct messages.
You decide what goes in the log file by querying slack with its API just as you would from the slack app.
You can also delete these same messages from slack after writing them to the log.  Works fine on accounts with thousands or tens of thousands of messages.  Log file contains links to slack archive, files, google docs, etc.
