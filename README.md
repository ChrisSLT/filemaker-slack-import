# filemaker-slack-import

## Purpose
In Filemaker Pro, create an easy to read html log of slack messages from public or private groups and direct messages.
You decide what goes in the log file by querying slack with its API just as you would from the slack app.

I am new to github and will try to add the code/files.  Send me a message if there is interest and I'll try to move faster.

Thanks!
